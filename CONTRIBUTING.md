Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project welcomes issues and pull requests.

## How to Contribute

- Open an issue first for significant changes to discuss approach and scope

## Local Setup

- Load the extension via `chrome://extensions` â†’ `Load unpacked`
- Edit `popup.html`, `popup.js`, and `background.js`
- Use DevTools (Inspect popup and service worker) for debugging

## Pull Request Checklist

- Linked issue (if applicable)
